# Note

This is an old project. If you're looking for examples of my coding style or approach to coding, this
is probably not the best place to start.

A better place to start would be <https://github.com/willkoehler/vending_machine_kata_solution> or
<https://github.com/willkoehler/bank_ocr_kata_solution>

Beyond that, my best work is in private repos. I'm happy to provide code samples on request.
